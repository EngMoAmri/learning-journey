# Dockerfile

## Example

```Dockerfile
FROM <base-image>
WORKDIR <directory>
COPY <from> <to>
RUN <command_name>
CMD ["executable","param1","param2",...]
ENV <name> <value>
EXPOSE <port>
VOLUME <directory>
ENTRYPOINT ["executable","param1","param2",...]
```
- ```FROM``` here we import the base image
    #### NOTES
    - [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) Here to find images information and also you can find at Tag tab you can see the images sizes
    - images with ```alpine``` in them are the minimal Docker image based on Alpine Linux

- ```WORKDIR``` instruction sets the working directory for any command that follows it in the Dockerfile
- ```COPY``` instruction to copy local files from the host machine to the current working directory
- ```RUN``` instruction to execute commands that will run during the image build process
- ```CMD``` instruction sets the command that will be executed when a container is run from the image
- ```ENV``` instruction to set environment variables inside the image which will be available during build time as well as in a running container
- ```EXPOSE``` command to tell Docker which ports the container will listen on at runtime, However, the instruction does not result in a port being automatically bound when the container starts.
- ```VOLUME``` instruction for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers
- ```ENTRYPOINT```  instruction specifies the command that should be executed when the container starts


## ```ENTRYPOINT``` V.S ```CMD```

The ENTRYPOINT specifies a command that will always be executed when the container starts.

The CMD specifies arguments that will be fed to the ENTRYPOINT.

If you want to make an image dedicated to a specific command you will use ENTRYPOINT ["/path/dedicated_command"]

Otherwise, if you want to make an image for general purpose, you can leave ENTRYPOINT unspecified and use CMD ["/path/dedicated_command"] as you will be able to override the setting by supplying arguments to docker run.
